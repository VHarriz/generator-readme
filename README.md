# Professional README Generator
In this project I had to make a README generator in the command line. Using node and inquirer npm package.

## Video Link
This is the link to the recorded video of me using the README generator: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ch1Q_R47NIUJ_nJ75mb0V84gFIsZZ9qQ/view?usp=sharing

I looked at some youtube videos and used the class content provided to me.
